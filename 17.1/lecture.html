   How big is Mt. Rainier?
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   A large mining company has decided it wants to turn Mt. Rainier into pure profit by smashing and carting the whole thing away one rock at a time (for use in fishtanks). They ask the piglet of calculus to help them calculate the amount of rock they will end up with.
  </p>
  <p class="slide question">
   What are the piglet's options?
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   (Note: the piglet has access to the Puget Sound LIDAR Consortium's data set.)

   Remember Riemann sums?
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   In your calculus youth, you learned about integration via
   <span class="important">
    Riemann sums
   </span>
   .
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   <span class="important">
    Recall:
   </span>
   given a function $f(x)$ defined on an interval $[a,b]$ and an integer $n$, we form the $n$th Riemann sum like this:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$S_n=\sum_{i=1}^nf\left(a+(2i-1)\frac{b-a}{2n}\right)\frac{1}{n}=\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)\Delta(x)$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   <span class="important">
    The idea:
   </span>
   divide the interval into $n$ equal pieces, evaluate the function in the middle of each interval, and add up the areas of the resulting rectangles.

  <h2>
   Stew in brain juices
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   Try to set up a similar thing for functions of two variables $f(x,y)$ over a rectangle $[a,b]\times[c,d]$: $x$ goes from $a$ to $b$ and $y$ goes from $c$ to $d$.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Some components you might want to use to start:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^n\qquad\qquad \Delta(x)\qquad\qquad \Delta(y)\qquad\qquad f\qquad\qquad x_{ij}\qquad\qquad y_{ij}$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   This is not just a mindless exercise. How would you program a computer to make these approximations? Work backwards from there if you want!
  </p>
  <p class="slide" style="color:#aaaaaa">
   Maybe I just worked some magic to make those models before.

   Riemann sums over rectangles

   Here's one possible answer:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Suppose $f(x,y)$ is defined and continuous on the rectangle $$[a,b]\times[c,d]=\{(x,y) | a\leq x\leq b, c\leq y\leq d\}.$$ "The"
