   Medium-term question
  </h2>
  <p>
   A fun-loving electron is traveling in a spiral path around the surface of a torus.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    The radius of the torus (i.e., the radius of the circle at the center of the tube) is $2$ and the diameter of the circular cross-section is $1$.
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    The electron starts at position $(1,0,0)$, travels at a constant angular velocity around the vertical axis of $1$ radian per second, and its path winds up and around the torus $4$ times before it returns to its starting position.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="slide">
   What is the position and velocity of the electron at time $t$?

   A similar but simpler question

  <p>
   A socially awkward electron is traveling in a spiral path around the surface of a cylinder.
   <ul>
    <li class="slide">
     The cylinder has radius $1$ and height $4$

    <li class="slide">
     The electron starts at position $(1,0,0)$, travels counterclockwise at a rotational speed of $1$ radian per second.

    <li class="slide">
     Its path winds around the cylinder exactly $4$ times when it reaches the top.

    What is the electron's position at time $t$?

   Teach the piglet of calculus

  <h3>
   How can we break down the motion into pieces the piglet of calculus can digest?
  </h3>
  <ul class="incremental">
   <li>
    How would you explain the motion to the piglet?
   </li>
   <li>
    The piglet needs a precise description in order to predict future positions.
   </li>
   <li>
    If the piglet fails, it's bacon time. Don't let that happen.
   </li>
   <li>
    Any ideas?

   Parametric description
  </h2>
  <p>
   We can trace the coordinates of the electron as it moves, giving functions
            $$\begin{align*}
            x&amp;=x(t)\\
            y&amp;=y(t)\\
            z&amp;=z(t)
            \end{align*}
            $$
   <p class="slide">
    Equivalent formulation: view $\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\rangle$ as a
    <span class="important">
     vector-valued function
    </span>
    .
    <p class="slide">
     How do we figure out these functions?
