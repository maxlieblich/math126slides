        <p class="slide">
            It's still 1999, still before the bursting of the tech stock bubble, and Nedwina and the piglet of calculus have stock market fever.
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
            (This is still not a good sign.)
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
            Nedwina and the piglet realize that they need to do better than a linear approximation if they want to outsmart the Slimy Stock Snail. Recall that the best linear approximation is:
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
            $$f(t)=10000+3000t,$$
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
            where $t$ is the time in days from now. In addition, by analyzing the data, Nedwina and the piglet conclude that the best linear approximation to the first derivative of $f$ is
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
            $$g(t)=3000-10t.$$

        <h2>Is it ever enough?</h2>
        <p class="slide question">
            Using their New and Improved Better Tasting Stock Toothpick (&copy; 1999), how far off can N and the P be in six months? What additional information would help? Do they have enough juice?
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
            What kinds of additional information could N and the P use to evaluate the accuracy of the new approximation?

        <h2>Quadratic approximation</h2>
        <p class="slide">What kind of quadratic approximation do we get from our two pieces?</p>
        <p class="slide">If $D(t)$ is the value of the DJIA, then $f(t)=10000+3000t$ approximates $D(t)$ and $g(t)=3000-10t$ approximates $D'(t)$.</p>
        <p class="slide">Integrating $g(t)$ and accounting for the initial value (which we can compute as $f(0)$), we get an approximation function</p>
        <p class="slide">$$h(t)=10000+3000t-5t^2.$$</p>
        <p class="slide important">This is the best quadratic approximation to our function.</p>
        <p class="slide">General formula: the best quadratic approximation to $f(t)$ around the point $t=b$ is given by $$T_2(x)=f(b)+f'(b)(x-b)+\frac{1}{2}f''(b)(x-b)^2.$$</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>

            Let's continue with the some examples from last time. Here are a bunch of functions with their quadratic approximations around $t=0$:

        <ul class="incremental">

        </ul>
        <p class="slide">The formula again: the <span class="important">$n$th Taylor polynomial</span> of $f(x)$ around $b$ is</p>
