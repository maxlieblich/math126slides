   Nedwina Cummerbund and the Ankles of Doom
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   Nedwina is standing on her favorite part of Rainier, given by the equation $x^3+z^2(y^2+y^3)+x+y+z=0.$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   The tangent plane: $x+y+z=0$.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   The angle with the $xy$-plane is the angle between the normal vectors $\langle 1,0,0\rangle$ and $\langle 1,1,1\rangle$: $\cos(\theta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   The angle is about $54.74^\circ$, slightly less than the $60^\circ$ limit set by the doctor. Phew!
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Nedwina has her pet slug Boffo with her. Boffo is very sensitive to changes in elevation. He asks, sliming with fear:
  </p>
  <p class="slide question">
   "How many cm higher or lower will I be if you follow the path that goes 2cm in the $x$ direction and 1 cm in the $y$ direction?"

  <h2>
   Centimeters are small
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   For making small changes, we can use the linear approximation to the function!
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    The best linear approximation to the nerd's model of Rainier at $(0,0,0)$ is the function $z=-x-y$.
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    Tiny changes in $x$ and $y$: $\Delta x=0.02$ meters and $\Delta y=0.01$ meters.
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    We get $\Delta z=-\Delta x-\Delta y=-0.03$ meters, or $3$ centimeters lower.
   </li>

   Name for this: differentials
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   These tiny changes are called
   <span class="important">
    differentials
   </span>
   , and our best linear approximation lets us compute them.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   <span class="important">
    General formula:
   </span>
   if $z=f(x,y)$ then $dz=f_x(x,y)dx+f_y(x,y)dy$. We get the tiny change in $z$ coming from that tiny change in the position of the point $(x,y)$ using the partial derivatives according to the formula.

   Try one: find the differentials of $f(x,y)=x^y$.
