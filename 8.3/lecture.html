   A new problem
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   A joey (baby kangaroo) is riding in her mother's pouch. She has a smartphone
            with an accelerometer that continuously reports the acceleration vector. Her friend wrote an app
            that calculates the velocity at any moment in time $t$.
            She is too small to see out of the pouch, but, like all infant kangaroos,
            she is interested in calculating her position as a function of time.
            Sadly, her somewhat stupid friend never figured out how to get the position
            before he started a new app that mimics the hilarious sounds that giraffes make when embarrassed.

  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    The joey records the velocity at time $t$ as $$\mathbf v(t)=\langle 1,t,\sin(t)\rangle$$
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    The joey starts at the point $(0,0,1)$
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    Where is the joey at time $t$?

   Integrate!

  <p class="slide">
   Just like one variable calculus: reconstruct position from velocity by

    integrating

   .

  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    Riemann sums: $\sum\mathbf v(t_i)\Delta(t)$
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    Practical: $$\int\langle x(t),y(t),z(t)\rangle dt=\left\langle\int x(t)dt,\int y(t)dt,\int z(t)dt\right\rangle.$$
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    Example:
                $$\int\langle 1,t,t^2\rangle dt=\langle a,b,c\rangle+\left\langle t,\frac{1}{2}t^2,\frac{1}{3}t^3\right\rangle$$

    The constant of integration is now a vector!

   Using vector integration, compute the path that the joey takes, starting at $t=0$.
            Initial position: $(0,0,1)$, velocity $\langle 1,t,\sin(t)\rangle$.
