   An incredibly entertaining application of double integrals: area!
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   We've been thinking about double integrals as computing volume.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   They also compute area! Given a region $R$,
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$\iint_R1dA=\text{area}(R).$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   This can be
   <span class="important">
    useful
   </span>
   when we can find nice coordinates.

   Example
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   Let's consider one of the marvelous polar shapes from before.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   How about the area inside the curve $r=1+\sin(3\theta)$?
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   <img alt="There would be a flower here. Sigh." src="20.1/flower.png" style="width:400px;float:left;"/>
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   The integral becomes $$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{1+\sin(3\theta)}rdrd\theta$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Evaluate it, get $\frac{1}{2}\theta-\frac{1}{3}\cos(3\theta)+\frac{1}{24}(6\theta-\sin(6\theta))|_0^{2\pi}=\frac{3}{2}\pi$
  </p>
  <p class="slide important">
   Be careful about how path is traversed!

  <h2>
   Do one!
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   Consider the delightful logarithmic spiral:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$r=e^{\theta/5}.$$
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    What is the area of the first full turn of the spiral ($0\leq\theta\leq 2\pi$)?
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    What is the limit of the area inside the spiral $r=e^{\alpha\theta}$ as $\alpha$ tends to $0$?
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
   One more, for extra fun
  </h2>
  <p>
   Suppose there is a snail whose shell is built around the spiral like this: between each point of the spiral and the center there is a circle of shell material. Thus, the circle connecting the center to the point with polar coordinates $(\theta,e^{\theta/5})$ has radius $\frac{1}{2}e^{\theta/5}$ and is centered at the point with polar coordinates $(\theta,\frac{1}{2}e^{\theta/5})$. Write down an explicit integral that computes the volume of the shell.
  </p>
  <!--<p>Write $z$ as a function of $r$ and $\theta$: $z=\sqrt{e^{\theta/5}r-r^2}$ (why does that work?!?!).</p>-->
