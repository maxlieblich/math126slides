   Nedwina and the piglet play the market
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   It's 1999, right before the bursting of the tech stock bubble, and Nedwina and the piglet of calculus have stock market fever.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   (This is not a good sign.)
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Their friend, the Slimy Stock Snail, tells them that the best linear approximation to the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$f(t)=10000+3000t,$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   where $t$ is the time in days from now.
  </p>
  <p class="slide question">
   What could go wrong?

   More precisely:
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   What kinds of additional information do Nedwina and the piglet need to evaluate the accuracy of the linear approximation?
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Can they be sure that the projection will be within 5000 of the correct value in one year?!?!

   Examples
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   Let's start with some simple minded examples. Here are a bunch of functions with derivative $0$ at $t=0$:
  </p>
  <ul class="slide">
   <li>
    $f(t)=t^2$
   </li>
   <li>
    $f(t)=t^3$
   </li>
   <li>
    $f(t)=\cos(t)-1$
   </li>
   <li>
    $f(t)=t^{10}$
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="slide">
   In each case, the best linear approximation around $t=0$ is the function $L(t)=0$.
  </p>
  <p class="slide question">
   How can we capture the error in this approximation at $t=730$, i.e., how can we bound the absolute value $|L(730)-f(730)|$?
  </p>

  <h2>
   Photographic evidence
  </h2>
  <p>
   Here's a graph showing all of the functions between $t=0$ and $t=2$

  <p class="slide">
   None of the functions is especially close, but some are
   <span class="important">
    much worse
   </span>
   than others.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   The "rate of climb" of each graph seems to predict how far off the approximation is.

  <p class="slide">
   How about we start with a crudely wonderful estimate of values of the function:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   <span class="important">
    Theorem:
   </span>
   if there is a number $M$ such that $|f'(x)|\leq M$ for all $x$ between $b$ and $c$ then
   <span class="centermath">
    $$|f(c)-f(b)|\leq M|c-b|.$$
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Indication of proof:
   <span class="centermath">
    $$|f(c)-f(b)|=\left|\int_b^c f'(x)dx\right|\leq\left|\int_b^c |f'(x)|dx\right|\leq\left|\int_b^c Mdx\right|=M|c-b|.$$
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   <span class="important">
    Example:
   </span>
   $f(x)=\sin(x)$: $|f'(x)|\leq 1$ for all $x$, so $|f(c)-f(b)|\leq|c-b|$ for all $b,c$.
  </p>
  <p class="slide question">
   How good an estimate is this?

  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Given a differentiable function $f(t)$ and a point $b$ where $f$ is defined, the best linear approx to $f(t)$ near $b$ is $L_b(t)=f(b)+f'(b)(t-b)$.

  <p class="slide">
   <span class="important">
    Theorem:
   </span>
   if $M$ is a number such that $|f''(x)|\leq M$ for all $x$ between $b$ and $c$ then $|L_b(c)-f(c)|\leq \frac{1}{2}M|c-b|^2$.

    Examples

  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    $f(t)=t^{10}$: $|f''(t)|\leq 10\cdot 9\cdot 2^8=23040$ for $0\leq t\leq 2$, so $|L_0(2)-f(2)|\leq 46080$ (ugh?)
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    $f(t)=\sin(t)$: $|f''(t)|\leq 1$ for all $t$, so for any value $c$ we have $|L_b(c)-f(c)|\leq \frac{1}{2}|c-b|^2$.

  <p class="slide question">
   Consider the function $f(t)=\cos(t)$. Find a number $c$ such that on the interval $[\pi/2,c]$,
            the linear approximation $L_{\pi/2}(t)$ to $f(t)$ is always within $0.01$ of $f(t)$.

    Hint:
   </span>
   try to bound the second derivative, and 
            combine this with the theorem: $|f''(x)|\leq M$ implies $|L_b(x)-f(x)|\leq\frac{1}{2}M|x-b|^2$.
