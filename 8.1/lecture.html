   Question
  </h2>
  <p>
   A fun-loving electron is traveling in a spiral path around the surface of a torus.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    The radius of the torus (i.e., the radius of the circle at the center of the tube) is $2$ and the diameter of the circular cross-section is $1$.
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    The electron starts at position $(1,0,0)$, travels at a constant angular velocity around the vertical axis of $1$ radian per second, and its path winds up and around the torus $4$ times before it returns to its starting position.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="slide">
   What is the position and velocity of the electron at time $t$?

  <p class="slide">
   Using the tools from last time, here is a parametric description of the motion:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$(x,y,z)=(\cos(t)(2-\cos(4t)),\sin(t)(2-\cos(4t)),\sin(4t))$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   In vector form:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$\mathbf f(t)=\langle \cos(t)(2-\cos(4t)),\sin(t)(2-\cos(4t)),\sin(4t)\rangle$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   What is the velocity? What
   <em>
    should
   </em>
   it be?

  <h2>
   Velocity: derivative of position, right?
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   We should have that the velocity of the electron is $$\mathbf v(t)=\mathbf f'(t).$$
   <span class="slide">
    But what is this?
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Classical definition of the derivative still works for vector-valued functions:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$\mathbf f'(t)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\mathbf f(t+h)-\mathbf f(t)}{h}$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   As usual, the derivative of the position
   <span class="important">
    vector
   </span>
   is the velocity
