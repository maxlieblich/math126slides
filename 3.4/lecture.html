   Original question
  </h2>
  <div class="incremental">
   <p>
    How do we calculate the projection of a vector into a
    <span class="important">
     plane
    </span>
    ?
   </p>
   <p>
    What is the projection in human terms? "Walk along the plane from the origin of the vector until you are just underneath
        its tip."
   </p>
   <p>
    So: if you look straight "up" (perpendicular to the plane) from the endpoint of the projection, you see
        the endpoint of the original vector.
   </p>
   <p>
    How do we express "first go here, then go there" using vectors?
   </p>
   <p>
    What if you project onto the line perpendicular to the plane and subtract that projection from the original vector?
