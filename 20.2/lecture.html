   Question
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   Nedwina enjoys eating roadkill. She has found a squashed squirrel in the shape of the unit square centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane; its density at a point $(x,y)$ is $e^{x+y}$. In order to cook the squirrel correctly, Nedwina has to balance it on the top of a narrow stick. How should she lay the flat and rigid squirrel on the stick?

   Re-phrase: where is the
   <span class="important">
    center of mass
   </span>
   of the flattened squirrel?

    Here is a representation in which the intensity of color is proportional to the density $e^{x+y}$.

   Computing center of mass
  </h2>
  <p class="slide">
   Let's suppose we have a planar lamina $D$ with a function $\rho(x,y)$ describing the density of the lamina at a point $(x,y)$.
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   Just like in Math 125, we compute the center of mass by dividing the moments around the $x$ and $y$ axes by the mass. In integrals, the location $(\overline x,\overline y)$ of the center of mass will be:
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$\overline x=\frac{\iint_Dx\rho(x,y)dA}{\iint_D\rho(x,y)dA}$$
  </p>
  <p class="slide">
   $$\overline y=\frac{\iint_Dy\rho(x,y)dA}{\iint_D\rho(x,y)dA}$$

   A steam roller comes by and runs over the squirrel. The poor thing now occupies the square $[-1,1]\times[-1,1]$ with density function $\rho(x,y)=\alpha e^{x+y}$ (where $\alpha$ is a constant that keeps the total mass constant; find it if you feel like it).
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li class="slide">
    What is the new center of mass?
   </li>
   <li class="slide">
    Suppose this procedure repeats so that the $n$th time the steam roller runs over the squirrel the square becomes $[-2+e^{-n},2-e^{-n}]\times [-2+e^{-n},2-e^{-n}]$ and the density becomes $\rho(x,y)=\alpha_n e^{x/n+y/n}$ (for an appropriate constant $\alpha_n$ to keep the mass constant). What is the limiting position of the center of mass as $n\to\infty$?
